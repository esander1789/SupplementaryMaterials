<H1>Noisy synchronization sets for noninvertible drives</H1>

We performed simulations for a drive-response system of the form
(x,y)->(f(x),g(x,y)), where f(x) is a tent map with slope c.

<B>Figure 1:</B> In this first set of simulations, the response is
quadratic: g(x,y) = dy+x^2.  for a large range of d values (0.1 < d <
0.5), the noise added to the drive had less of an effect than the same
noise added to the response.  The noise is additive Gaussian noise
with a variance of 0.003. Here c=1.9, d=0.1.

<B>Figure 3:</B> In this second set of simulations, the response is
sinusoidal: g(x,y) = ky+sin(2 pi x).  For a large range of d values
(0.1 < k < 0.6), the noise added to the response had less of an effect
than the same noise added to the drive.  The noise is additive
Gaussian noise with a variance of 0.01. Here c=1.9, k=0.25.
